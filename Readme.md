# Morris Mano Basic Computer

This is the implementation of Morris Mano Basic Computer section 5.9 of the Computer System Architecture book by M. Mano, and its components are entirely explained in the book.\\
There is a simple program in "12+18_image". You can use it by right-clicking on the memory in the Main circuit and loading the image. It should sum 0012 and 0018 (Hex) and write 002a on the memory.\\
It is implemented in Logisim, a free Java program for simulating circuits, so to run my implementation, you need to download the Logisim and install Java.\\
If you have a problem opening Logisim in macOS, you can right-click on the Logisim logo, select Show Package Contents, open Contents/Resources/Java, and run logisim.jar.
